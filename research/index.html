<h2>Carbonate diagenesis</h2>

<p>
For geochemists and Earth historians alike diagenesis is often regarded as a problem
to be avoided. Diagenetic processes add complexity to the geochemical signals and
in the worst case can obliterate the primary environmental information. Instead of
attempting to avoid diagenesis, our research seeks to extract the primary chemical
information from ancient carbonate sediments by better understanding the diagenetic
processes. Diagenetic reactions involve fluids in the subsurface and the amount of
fluid flow determines the extent to which diagenesis alters or preserves the original
geochemical signals (fluid- and sediment-buffered diagenesis).
We have developed a numerical model that simulates these reactions between carbonate
and pore-fluids along a flow path (<a href=" ../publications/Ahm2018.pdf">Ahm et al., 2018</a>).
    The model has been ground-truthed against measurements of calcium and magnesium
    isotopes from modern to Neogene carbonate sediments in the Bahamas. By
    quantifying the style and extent of early marine diagenesis (fluid- versus
    sediment-buffered), this model can explain much of the stratigraphic and lateral
    variability observed in the chemistry of Neogene shallow-water carbonate sediments
    and extract the chemical composition of contemporaneous seawater. When applied to
    ancient carbonate sediments, the model can be used to 'see through' diagenesis and
    more accurately reconstruct records of past seawater chemistry. Ongoing research
    involve integrating additional geochemical proxies into the model framework and
    seek to generate complementary datasets (e.g., for Li and S isotopes see Murphy et al., 2021 and Bryant et al., 2022, respectively).

<h2>Neoproterozoic carbon isotope excursions</h2>

<p>The variability in carbon isotope values from Neoproterozoic platform carbonates
  exceeds that of the Cenozoic deep sea record by almost an order of magnitude.
  The Neoproterozoic record is characterized by high baseline values +5-10&#8240
  that are interrupted by dramatic negative excursions with values down to -15&#8240.
  The origins of the Neoproterozoic carbon isotope excursions are still widely debated,
  because &#948<sup>13</sup>C values below -5&#8240 can not be explained by a traditional
  steady state carbon cycle model.
  A continued research effort in the Earth history group is investigating the link
  between the local depositional environment and diagenetic history of these Neoproterozoic
  carbonates. In addition to constraining the effects from diagenesis,
  we attempt to disentangle the influence of primary variabilities in local surface-waters
  chemistry on stratigraphic records from platform carbonates. Local effects are
  important to consider because observation from modern shallow-water depositional
  systems have shown that local carbon cycling and diagenesis largely
  controls the carbon isotope values of platform carbonates.
  Research in the group, and with collaborators, spans several Neoproterzoic carbon
  isotope excursions such as the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary, the Ediacaran Shuram
  excursion, the snowball Earth cap carbonates, the Trezona excursion, the Taishir
  excursion, and the Islay excursion.

<h2>The origins of life and the Great Oxidation Event</h2>

<p>Throughout the history of our planet, Earth's surface has gone through critical
transitions. Perhaps most dramatic is the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis
and the rise of atmospheric oxygen more than 2.3 billion years ago (the Great
Oxidation Event). This event is expected to have caused major changes in the
global carbon cycle, which may be recorded by the composition of stable carbon
isotopes in carbonate rocks. However, ancient carbonate sediments deposited
before the Great Oxidation Event have baseline carbon isotope values of
approximately 0&#8240 - broadly similar to baseline values recorded in Phanerozoic!
This observation challenges our understanding of how sediments record and preserve
signals of the global carbon cycle. It is likely that the carbon cycle on early
Earth was significantly different from the modern and included fluxes that may
not exist on Earth today. Moreover, only a fraction of ancient carbonate sediments
is preserved in the geologic record due to the continuous recycling of ocean crust
through the forces of plate tectonics. The chemistry of sediment may also be altered
during the transformation of primary sediment into rocks (diagenesis). As a result,
it is possible that the chemistry of the ancient carbonate sediments is not telling
us a true story of the ancient carbon cycle. Ongoing research in the Earth history
group includes using calcium and magnesium isotope measurements from Archean carbonates
to better understand the carbon cycle on early Earth.

            <h2>Kinetic effects on seawater carbonate chemistry</h2>

            <p>Shallow marine carbonate sediments are deposited in shallow restricted
              environments where the chemistry of the surface waters are significantly offset
              from the chemistry of the open ocean. As a result, it is difficult to directly
              link the geochemistry of ancient platform sediments with changes in global geochemical
              cycles. In the Earth history group, we explore how air-sea gas exchange of carbon
              dioxide and may affect surface water chemistry and the carbon-isotopic
              composition of platform carbonate sediments.
              <br><br>
              Highly variable carbon isotope DIC values in shallow-water environments
              are possible due to slow rates of air-sea gas exchange, meaning that surface water
              carbon isotope values can diverge from equilibrium with the overlying
              atmosphere. The exchange of carbon dioxide across the air-sea interface is
              associated with kinetic isotope effects, with the preferential dissolution and
              degassing of 12C. Surface waters that have low DIC concentrations
              with net invasion of carbon dioxide may therefore have lower carbon isotope
              values compared to surface waters with high DIC concentration and net
              degassing of carbon dioxide. In the modern open-ocean these kinetic effects are
              relatively small. In contrast, kinetic isotope effects associated with gas exchange
              can be pronounced in shallow-water hypersaline and restricted environments
              (e.g., Lazar and Erez, 1992; Clark et al. 1992; Beeler et al. 2020).
              In these settings, carbonate with carbon isotope values between -25 and +15&#8240
              have been documented. We use numerical models, ground-truthed in modern observations,
              to explore kinetic isotope effects associated with air-sea gas exchange of carbon
              dioxide and explore the potential role of kinetic isotopes effect in ancient
              platform sediments.</p>

<h2>Sensitivity of Fe speciation to oxidative weathering</h2>

      <!-- <img src=" ../photoDan.jpg" width="5O%" align=âtopâ /> -->
              <p>The concentration of reactive Fe in sedimentary rocks is extremely sensitive to
                modern weathering processes. Understanding the record of redox sensitive
                elements in ancient sediments is fundamental for extracting records of the
                concentration of atmospheric oxygen through Earth history. By using trace
                element analysis of samples from a shallow drill-core and coincident
                outcrop from Vinini Creek (Central Nevada), we found that in core samples there
                is abundant iron bound to pyrite and siderite minerals. In contrast, in outcrop
                samples much of that iron had been remobilized and transformed into iron oxides.
                This work emphasizes the limitations for using measurements of the concentration
                of pyrite and iron oxide in rocks collected from outcrop to infer past changes
                in oxygen levels (the iron speciation proxy) and highlights the need for more
                robust methods to evaluate the degree of alteration and diagenesis in ancient
                sediments.
