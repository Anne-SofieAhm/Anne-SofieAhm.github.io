  The Earth history team is and interdisciplinary research group that spans
  fields of geochemistry, geobiology, field geology, and computational modeling.
  We are particularly interested in the co-evolution of climate and life across
  Earth history, from >3 billions years ago until today.

<h2>Carbonate diagenesis</h2>

<p>
For geochemists and Earth historians alike diagenesis is often regarded as a problem
to be avoided. Diagenetic process adds complexity to the geochemical signals and
in the worst case can obliterate the primary environmental information. Instead of
attempting to avoid diagenesis, our research seeks to extract the primary chemical
information from ancient carbonate sediments by better understanding the diagenetic
processes. Diagenetic reactions involve fluids in the subsurface and the amount of
fluid flow determines the extent to which diagenesis alters or preserves the original
geochemical signals (fluid- and sediment-buffered diagenesis).
We have developed a numerical model that simulates these reactions between carbonate
and pore-fluids along a flow path <a href="../publications/Ahm2018.pdf">Ahm et al., 2018</a>.
The model has been ground-truthed against measurements of calcium and magnesium
isotopes from modern to Neogene carbonate sediments in the Bahamas. By
quantifying the style and extent of early marine diagenesis (fluid- versus
sediment-buffered), this model can explain much of the stratigraphic and lateral
variability observed in the chemistry of Neogene shallow-water carbonate sediments
and extract the chemical composition of contemporaneous seawater. When applied to
ancient carbonate sediments, the model can be used to `see through' diagenesis and
more accurately reconstruct records of past seawater chemistry. Future research,
involve integrate additional geochemical proxies into the model framework and seek
to generate complimentary datasets.

635 million years ago, the surface of our planet went through dramatic changes
during the aftermath of the last great Snowball Earth. This period is marked by
conspicuous dolostone units that cap glacial deposits worldwide - the basal
Ediacaran cap dolostones. By measuring calcium and magnesium isotope ratios in
cap dolostone units from across the world, we have identified spatial patterns
of fluid flow that record the circulation of glacial seawater beneath the
seafloor during Snowball Earth deglaciation. This research has revealed that
the geochemical variability recorded in cap dolostones largely is the product
of local diagenetic processes expressed globally in continental margins.
The descent into the last great Snowball Earth glaciation is recorded by an
extreme negative carbon isotope excursion - The Trezona anomaly. This
pre-glacial excursion is found globally in carbonate rocks and reaches enigmatic
carbon isotope values of -10 per mill. Through measurements of calcium and
magnesium isotopes, I am currently exploring the relative timing and potential
drivers for this excursion.

<h2>The origins of life and the Great Oxidation Event</h2>

<p>Throughout the history of our planet, Earth's surface has gone through critical
transitions. Perhaps most dramatic is the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis
and the rise of atmospheric oxygen more than 2.3 billion years ago (the Great
Oxidation Event). This event is expected to have caused major changes in the
global carbon cycle, which may be recorded by the composition of stable carbon
isotopes in carbonate rocks. However, ancient carbonate sediments deposited
before the Great Oxidation Event have baseline carbon isotope values of
approximately 0&#8240 - broadly similar to baseline values recorded in Phanerozoic!
This observation challenges our understanding of how sediments record and preserve
signals of the global carbon cycle. It is likely that the carbon cycle on early
Earth was significantly different from the modern and included fluxes that may
not exist on Earth today. Moreover, only a fraction of ancient carbonate sediments
is preserved in the geologic record due to the continuous recycling of ocean crust
through the forces of plate tectonics. The chemistry of sediment may also be altered
during the transformation of primary sediment into rocks (diagenesis). As a result,
it is possible that the chemistry of the ancient carbonate sediments is not telling
us a true story of the ancient carbon cycle. Ongoing research in the Earth history
group includes using calcium and magnesium isotope measurements from the Steep Rock
area in Northern Ontario to better understand the carbon cycle on early Earth.

  <h2>Sensitivity of Fe speciation to oxidative weathering</h2>
    <p>
              <img src="../photoDan.jpg" width="5O%" align=”top”/>
      The concentration of reactive Fe in sedimentary rocks is extremely sensitive to
      modern weathering processes. Understanding the record of redox sensitive
      elements in ancient sediments is fundamental for extracting records of the
      concentration of atmospheric oxygen through Earth history. By using trace
      element analysis of samples from a shallow self-drilled core and coincident
      outcrop from Vinini Creek (Central Nevada), I found that in core samples there
      is abundant iron bound to pyrite and siderite minerals. In contrast, in outcrop
      samples much of that iron had been remobilized and transformed into iron oxides.
      This work emphasizes the limitations for using measurements of the concentration
      of pyrite and iron oxide in rocks collected from outcrop to infer past changes
      in oxygen levels (the iron speciation proxy) and highlights the need for more
      robust methods to evaluate the degree of alteration and diagenesis in ancient
      sediments.
