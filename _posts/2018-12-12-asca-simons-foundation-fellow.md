# NEWS:
I was just awarded a Simons Foundation Fellowship ([Origins of Life](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/origins-of-life).
From 2019-2022 I will be splitting my time between Caltech and Princeton University working on better understanding the chemistry of Archean carbonate sediments to constrain the fluxes of the global carbon cycle before and during the rise of atmospheric oxygen.
