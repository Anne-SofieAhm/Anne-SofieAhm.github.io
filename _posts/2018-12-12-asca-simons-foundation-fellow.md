## NEWS:
I was just awarded a Simons Foundation Fellowship ([Origins of Life](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/origins-of-life)).
The broad scope of this project is to improve our understanding of the chemistry of Archean carbonate sediments in order to better constrain the fluxes of the global carbon cycle before and during the rise of atmospheric oxygen.
