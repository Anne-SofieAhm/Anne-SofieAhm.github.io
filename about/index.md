<img align="right" width="300" src="Anne-SofieAhm.github.io/DSC_0086.JPG">

I have a PhD in Geoscience from the University of Copenhagen, completed in 2016, with a focus on using stable isotopes and trace element geochemistry to reconstruct changes in the surface conditions of Earth through time. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University working with isotopic measurements of Ca, Mg, and Sr in both modern and ancient carbonate sediments.
