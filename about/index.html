<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I have a PhD in Geoscience from the University of Copenhagen, completed in 2016,
  with a focus on using stable isotopes and trace element geochemistry to
  reconstruct changes in the surface conditions of Earth through time.
  Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University working with
  isotopic measurements of Ca, Mg, and Sr in both modern and ancient carbonate sediments.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>As an Earth Historian, I am interested in how we can use the chemistry of rocks
  to gain insight into the surface conditions of Earth in the past. The chemistry
  of marine carbonate sediments has been used to reconstruct the evolution of global
  biogeochemical cycles for a wide range of elements throughout the entirety of
  Earth history. However, one of the main limitations in using this geochemical
  archive is the susceptibility of carbonate sediments to diagenesis, as
  unlithified sediments are transformed into the rocks we can study in the
  geological record. Using multiple isotope systems and numerical models of
  diagenesis, my research seeks to extract the primary chemical information from
  ancient carbonate sediments by better understanding the diagenetic processes.</p>
