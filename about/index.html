<h1>Research Interests</h1>

<p>As an Earth Historian, I am interested in how we can use the chemistry of rocks to gain insight into the surface conditions of Earth in the past. The chemistry of marine carbonate sediments has been used to reconstruct the evolution of global biogeochemical cycles for a wide range of elements throughout the entirety of Earth history. However, one of the main limitations in using this geochemical archive is the susceptibility of carbonate sediments to diagenesis, as unlithified sediments are transformed into the rocks we can study in the geological record. Using multiple isotope systems and numerical models of diagenesis, my research seeks to extract the primary chemical information from ancient carbonate sediments by better understanding the diagenetic processes.</p>

<h3>Past and current projects</h3>

<p>I am particularly interested in the co-evolution of climate and life during fundamental transitional periods in Earth history such as the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth events, the
Cambrian explosion of animal life, and the end-Ordovician mass extinction.

<h5>Past and current projects</h5>
<p>635 million years ago, the surface of our planet went through dramatic changes during the aftermath of the last great Snowball Earth. This period is marked by conspicuous dolostone units that cap glacial deposits worldwide -- the basal Ediacaran cap dolostones. By measuring calcium and magnesium isotope ratios in cap dolostone units from across the world, we have identified spatial patterns of fluid flow that record the circulation of glacial seawater beneath the seafloor during Snowball Earth deglaciation. This research has revealed that the geochemical variability recorded in cap dolostones largely is the product of local diagenetic processes expressed globally in continental margins.
