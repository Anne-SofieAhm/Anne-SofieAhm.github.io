  <p>
    As an Earth Historian, I am interested in how we can use the chemistry of rocks
    to gain insight into the surface conditions of Earth in the past. The chemistry
    of marine carbonate sediments has been used to reconstruct the evolution of global
    biogeochemical cycles for a wide range of elements throughout the entirety of
    Earth history. However, one of the main limitations in using this geochemical
    archive is the susceptibility of carbonate sediments to diagenesis, as unlithified
    sediments are transformed into the rocks we can study in the geological record.
    Using multiple isotope systems and numerical models of diagenesis, my research
    seeks to extract the primary chemical information from ancient carbonate sediments
    by better understanding the diagenetic processes. I am particularly interested
    in the co-evolution of climate and life during fundamental transitional periods
    in Earth history such as the Great Oxidation Event, Neoproterozoic Snowball
    Earth events, the Cambrian explosion of animal life, and the end-Ordovician mass
    extinction.

  <h2>Daniel Garduño, PhD candidate</h2>

  <p>
    I am interested in investigating the interactions of climate, atmospheric chemistry,
    and geologic processes through Earth History. Specifically, my research focuses
    on the effects of the Great Oxidation Event on climate and atmospheric chemistry.
    The Great Oxidation Event fundamentally changed the Earth's surface redox conditions,
    increasing the atmosphere's oxygen content and affecting the Earth's biochemical
    cycles. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the Earth suffered a period of
    climatic upheaval after the Great Oxidation Event, going from periods of global
    glaciations to periods of stability. My research tries to understand why climate
    behaved like this after the Great Oxidation Event and how these changes in climate
    could have affected the atmospheric chemistry of the Earth and vice versa. I am
    using a combination of photochemical, climate and simple mass balance models to
    try to understand these problems.

    Hi there! I'm Maya, a San Franciscan attending the University of Victoria,
    and one of Dr. Ahm's Honours students. While we all focus on water and
    carbonate chemistry, I specialise in the biological influence on pH, DIC/ALK,
    and carbonate precipitation.
    When I'm not looking at weird bio-slimes, I enjoy video games, D\&D, and embroidery!

  <p>
    Going through my undergrad, I’ve developed a keen interest in ocean chemistry
    and global carbonate cycling. I am looking to explore the precipitation of
    carbonates in both marine and lacustrine environments as a means of understanding
    past climates and global events. I will be using mass balance models as a means of
    measuring and understanding the carbonate precipitation that occurs in high
    alkalinity lakes in Interior BC. Moving forward, I hope to connect the past to
    the future by taking my knowledge of carbonate precipitation and testing it on a
    larger scale with the global carbonate cycle and carbonate sequestration.
