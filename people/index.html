  As an Earth Historian, I am interested in how we can use the chemistry of rocks
  to gain insight into the surface conditions of Earth in the past. The chemistry
  of marine carbonate sediments has been used to reconstruct the evolution of global
  biogeochemical cycles for a wide range of elements throughout the entirety of
  Earth history. However, one of the main limitations in using this geochemical
  archive is the susceptibility of carbonate sediments to diagenesis, as unlithified
  sediments are transformed into the rocks we can study in the geological record.
  Using multiple isotope systems and numerical models of diagenesis, my research
  seeks to extract the primary chemical information from ancient carbonate sediments
  by better understanding the diagenetic processes. I am particularly interested
  in the co-evolution of climate and life during fundamental transitional periods
  in Earth history such as the Great Oxidation Event, Neoproterozoic Snowball
  Earth events, the Cambrian explosion of animal life, and the end-Ordovician mass
  extinction (<a href="/mycv/ASA_CV_2020.pdf">CV</a>).
