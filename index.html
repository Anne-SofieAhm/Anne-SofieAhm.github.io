	<h1>Anne-Sofie Cr√ºger Ahm</h1>
	<p>I have a PhD in Geoscience from the University of Copenhagen, completed in 2016, with a focus on using stable isotopes and trace element geochemistry to reconstruct changes in the surface conditions of Earth through time. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University working with isotopic measurements of Ca, Mg, and Sr in both modern and ancient carbonate sediments.
