		Anne-Sofie Ahm is an incoming Assistant Professor in the School of Earth and
		Ocean Sciences (<a href="https://www.uvic.ca/science/seos">SEOS</a>)
		at the University of Victoria (starting in 2022). Dr. Ahm
		aims to build an interdisciplinary research group that combines geochemistry,
		geobiology, field geology, and numerical modeling. Research questions will
		focus on understanding and improving the record of seawater chemistry and
		carbon cycling throughout Earth history, from 3 billion years ago untill today
		(<a href="/research">Read more about ongoing research projects...</a>).

		The research group will be part of a vibrant Earth history node at SEOS,
		which includes students and postdocs that work with
		<a href="http://www.jonhusson.com">Jon Husson</a> and
		<a href="http://blakedyer.com">Blake Dyer</a>.
		Currently, we are looking for motivated students to join the Earth history team!
