<p>I am particularly interested in the co-evolution of climate and life during fundamental transitional periods in Earth history such as the Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth events, the
Cambrian explosion of animal life, and the end-Ordovician mass extinction.

<p>Diagenetic reactions involve fluids from either rain (meteoric water), seawater,
  or deep crustal brines, that flow through the sediment. The amount of fluid flow
  determines the extent to which diagenesis alters or preserves the original geochemical
  signals (fluid- and sediment-buffered diagenesis). I have developed a numerical
  model that simulates these reactions between sediments and pore-fluids along
  the fluid flow path. The model has been ground-truthed against measurements of
  calcium and magnesium isotopes from modern to Neogene carbonate sediments in
  the Bahamas. By quantifying the style and extent of early marine diagenesis
  (fluid- versus sediment-buffered), this model can explain much of the stratigraphic
  and lateral variability observed in the chemistry of Neogene shallow-water
  carbonate sediments and extract the chemical composition of contemporaneous
  seawater.<p>
