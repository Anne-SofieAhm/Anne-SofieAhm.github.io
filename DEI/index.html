<p>
In the Earth history group, we embrace and encourage diversity in all forms and reject any form of discrimination.
Fostering the diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences that makes each of
us unique strengthens the quality, social relevance, and impact of our research endeavors.

<h2> Territory acknowledgement </h2>

<p>
  <i>We acknowledge with respect the Lekwungen peoples on whose traditional territory
  the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical
  relationships with the land continue to this day.</i>
  <br><br>
  UVic recognizes that colonization and associated attitudes, policies and institutions
  have significantly changed Indigenous peoples’ relationship with this land.
  And for many years those same things served to exclude Indigenous students from
  higher education. While there is much to be done to redress the historical and
  continued barriers facing Indigenous students, the territorial acknowledgement
  is an important part of working together with our local Indigenous communities
  in a good way.
  <br><br>
  It is a goal of the Earth history group to work with indigenous communities to
  increase representation and to embrace traditional knowledge.
  We acknowledge that establishing a working relationship with indigenous communities
  takes time and respect.

<h2> Unlearning Racism in Geoscience </h2>
<p>
  An important effort to increasing participation and retention of Black, Brown,
  and Indigenous people in Geoscience is to deepen our knowledge of the effects
  of racism in our field, both in the past and today.

  Events in 2020, including the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and others,
  ignited a global conversation across all sectors of society about racism, white
  supremacy, and other systems of oppression experienced by marginalized groups.
  The geoscience communityhas responded with statements, reading groups, and
  committees addressingthe overall lack of diversity, equity,and inclusionwithin
  our field. The sad truth is that our community has discussed its lack of diversity,
  particularly related to race and gender, for decades with few 36measurable improvements
  (Bromery et al., 1972;Bernard and Cooperdock, 2018). This lack of diversity,
  which spans race, gender, disability, sexuality and other social categories,
  contributes directly to the lack of inclusion and equity experienced by people
  from marginalized groups (Dutt, 2020).

  The academic Strike for Black Lives and #ShutDownSTEM day were a mass shutdown
  of academia that took place around the world on June 10, 2020. The main goals
  of the strike and the shut down were to reflect upon anti-Black racism in
  academia and STEM and to commit to actions to eradicate it.
