<p>
In the Earth history group, we embrace and encourage diversity in all forms and reject any form of discrimination.
Fostering the diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and experiences that makes each of
us unique strengthens the quality, social relevance, and impact of our research endeavors.

<h2> Territory acknowledgement </h2>

<p>
  <i>We acknowledge with respect the Lekwungen peoples on whose traditional territory
  the university stands and the Songhees, Esquimalt and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples whose historical
  relationships with the land continue to this day.<i>
  <br><br>
  UVic recognizes that colonization and associated attitudes, policies and institutions
  have significantly changed Indigenous peoples’ relationship with this land.
  And for many years those same things served to exclude Indigenous students from
  higher education. While there is much to be done to redress the historical and
  continued barriers facing Indigenous students, the territorial acknowledgement
  is an important part of working together with our local Indigenous communities
  in a good way.
  <br><br>
  It is a goal of the Earth history group to work with indigenous communities to
  increase representation and to embrace traditional knowledge.
  We acknowledge that establishing a working relationship with indigenous communities
  takes time and respect.
