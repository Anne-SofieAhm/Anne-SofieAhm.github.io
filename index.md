# Biography

<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="Anne-SofieAhm.github.io/DSC_0086.JPG">

I have a PhD in Geoscience from the University of Copenhagen, completed in 2016, with a focus on using stable isotopes and trace element geochemistry to reconstruct changes in the surface conditions of Earth through time. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Princeton University working with isotopic measurements of Ca, Mg, and Sr in both modern and ancient carbonate sediments.

### NEWS: I was just awarded a Simons Foundation Postdoctoral Fellowship (Origins of Life)
Starting April 2019, I will be splitting my time between Caltech and Princeton University working on better understanding the chemistry of Archean carbonate sediments to contrain the fluxes of the global carbon cycle before and during the rise of atmospheric oxygen at the Great Oxidation Event.

## Research Interests

As an Earth Historian, I am interested in how we can use the chemistry of rocks to gain insight into the surface conditions of Earth in the past. The chemistry of marine carbonate sediments has been used to reconstruct the evolution of global biogeochemical cycles for a wide range of elements throughout the entirety of Earth history. However, one of the main limitations in using this geochemical archive is the susceptibility of carbonate sediments to diagenesis, as unlithified sediments are transformed into the rocks we can study in the geological record. Using multiple isotope systems and numerical models of diagenesis, my research seeks to extract the primary chemical information from ancient carbonate sediments by better understanding the diagenetic processes.


## Geochemistry

I measure non-traditional stable isotopes (such as Ca, Mg, and stable Sr) and trace elements to investigate the diagenetic history of ancient sediments and reconstruct changes in the surface conditions of Earth through time. Different elements are separated from their matrix using an automated column chromotragphy system (Dionex). Following purification samples are measured on an ICP-MS multicollector.

Measurements of Ca isotopes on an ICP-MS multicollector has traditionally been difficult due to the interference between ArHH and 42Ca. As a result measurements are performed in medium resolution with cups centered on the "shoulder" of the 42Ca peak (see photo below).

## Quantifying carbonate diagenesis using Ca and Mg isotopes

Diagenetic reactions involve fluids from either rain (meteoric water), seawater, or deep crustal brines, that flow through the sediment. The amount of fluid flow determines the extent to which diagenesis alters or preserves the original geochemical signals (fluid- and sediment-buffered diagenesis). I have developed a numerical model that simulates these reactions between sediments and pore-fluids along the fluid flow path. The model has been ground-truthed against measurements of calcium and magnesium isotopes from modern to Neogene carbonate sediments in the Bahamas. By quantifying the style and extent of early marine diagenesis (fluid- versus sediment-buffered), this model can explain much of the stratigraphic and lateral variability observed in the chemistry of Neogene shallow-water carbonate sediments and extract the chemical composition of contemporaneous seawater.

## An early diagenetic origin for the basal Ediacaran cap carbonates

635 million years ago, the surface of our planet went through dramatic changes during the aftermath of the last great Snowball Earth. This period is marked by conspicuous dolostone units that cap glacial deposits worldwide -- the basal Ediacaran cap dolostones. By measuring calcium and magnesium isotope ratios in cap dolostone units from across the world, we have identified spatial patterns of fluid flow that record the circulation of glacial seawater beneath the seafloor during Snowball Earth deglaciation. This research has revealed that the geochemical variability recorded in cap dolostones largely is the product of local diagenetic processes expressed globally in continental margins.

## The Trezona carbon isotope anomaly

The descent into the last great Snowball Earth glaciation is recorded by an extreme negative carbon isotope excursion -- The Trezona anomaly. This pre-glacial excursion is found globally in carbonate rocks and reaches enigmatic carbon isotope values of -10 per mill. Through measurements of calcium and magnesium isotopes, I am currently exploring the relative timing and potential drivers for this excursion.

## Sensitivity of Fe speciation to oxidative weathering

The concentration of reactive Fe in sedimentary rocks is extremely sensitive to modern weathering processes. Understanding the record of redox sensitive elements in ancient sediments is fundamental for extracting records of the concentration of atmospheric oxygen through Earth history. By using trace element analysis of samples from a shallow self-drilled core and coincident outcrop from Vinini Creek (Central Nevada), I found that in core samples there is abundant iron bound to pyrite and siderite minerals. In contrast, in outcrop samples much of that iron had been remobilized and transformed into iron oxides. 
This work emphasizes the limitations for using measurements of the concentration of pyrite and iron oxide in rocks collected from outcrop to infer past changes in oxygen levels (the iron speciation proxy) and highlights the need for more robust methods to evaluate the degree of alteration and diagenesis in ancient sediments.
