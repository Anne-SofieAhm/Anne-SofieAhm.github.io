## The Geochemical Record of Earth History

The chemistry of marine carbonate sediments has been used to reconstruct the evolution of global biogeochemical cycles for a wide range of elements throughout the entirety of Earth history -- from prior to the Great Oxidation Event, through the Cambrian explosion of animal life, and continuing through the Phanerozoic to the present. 
However, one of the main limitations in using this geochemical archive is the susceptibility of carbonate sediments to diagenesis, as unlithified sediments are transformed into the rocks we can study in the geological record. 

For geochemists and Earth historians alike diagenesis is often regarded as a problem to be avoided. Diagenetic process adds complexity to the geochemical signals and in the worst case can obliterate the primary environmental information. 
Unfortunately, avoiding diagenesis is a difficult if not impossible task as diagenetic alteration of carbonates sediments has been shown to occur on all timescales (syn-depositional to late burial) and all length-scales (micrometers to kilometers). In contrast to previous attempts of avoiding diagenesis, my research seeks to extract the primary chemical information from ancient carbonate sediments by quantifying the diagenetic processes.


## Research Projects

### Quantifying carbonate diagenesis using Ca and Mg isotopes

Diagenetic reactions involve fluids from either rain (meteoric water), seawater, or deep crustal brines, that flow through the sediment. The amount of fluid flow determines the extent to which diagenesis alters or preserves the original geochemical signals (fluid- and sediment-buffered diagenesis). I have developed a numerical model that simulates these reactions between sediments and pore-fluids along the fluid flow path. The model has been ground-truthed against measurements of calcium and magnesium isotopes from modern to Neogene carbonate sediments in the Bahamas. By quantifying the style and extent of early marine diagenesis (fluid- versus sediment-buffered), this model can explain much of the stratigraphic and lateral variability observed in the chemistry of Neogene shallow-water carbonate sediments and extract the chemical composition of contemporaneous seawater. When applied to ancient carbonate sediments, the model can be used to see through' diagenesis and more accurately reconstruct records of past seawater chemistry. This modeling framework can also be used to make predictions for practically all carbonate-bound geochemical proxies (e.g., stable strontium isotopes, uranium isotopes, lithium isotopes, carbonate-associated sulfate). In future research, I will integrate these geochemical proxies into the model and seek to generate complimentary datasets.

### An early diagenetic origin for the basal Ediacaran cap carbonates
Following the last great Snowball Earth event, 635 million years ago, the surface of our planet went through dramatic changes. This period is marked by conspicuous dolostone units that cap glacial deposits worldwide (the basal Ediacaran cap dolostones). By measuring calcium and magnesium isotope ratios in cap dolostone units from across the world, we have identified spatial patterns of fluid flow that record the circulation of glacial seawater beneath the seafloor during Snowball Earth deglaciation. This research has revealed that the geochemical variability recorded in cap dolostones largely is the product of local diagenetic processes expressed globally in continental margins. As a result, this work has fundamentally changed our understanding of the evolution of seawater chemistry following a Snowball Earth and tackles on of the most challenging stratigraphic phenomenon in Earth history.
