## Research Interests

I consider myself both a geochemist and an Earth historian. I am interested in how we can use the chemistry of rock to gain insight into the surface conditions of Earth in the past. The chemistry of marine carbonate sediments has been used to reconstruct the evolution of global biogeochemical cycles for a wide range of elements throughout the entirety of Earth history -- from prior to the Great Oxidation Event, through the Cambrian explosion of animal life, and continuing through the Phanerozoic to the present. However, one of the main limitations in using this geochemical archive is the susceptibility of carbonate sediments to diagenesis, as unlithified sediments are transformed into the rocks we can study in the geological record. In contrast to previous attempts of avoiding diagenesis, my research seeks to extract the primary chemical information from ancient carbonate sediments by better understanding the diagenetic processes.

## Quantifying carbonate diagenesis using Ca and Mg isotopes

Diagenetic reactions involve fluids from either rain (meteoric water), seawater, or deep crustal brines, that flow through the sediment. The amount of fluid flow determines the extent to which diagenesis alters or preserves the original geochemical signals (fluid- and sediment-buffered diagenesis). I have developed a numerical model that simulates these reactions between sediments and pore-fluids along the fluid flow path. The model has been ground-truthed against measurements of calcium and magnesium isotopes from modern to Neogene carbonate sediments in the Bahamas. By quantifying the style and extent of early marine diagenesis (fluid- versus sediment-buffered), this model can explain much of the stratigraphic and lateral variability observed in the chemistry of Neogene shallow-water carbonate sediments and extract the chemical composition of contemporaneous seawater.

## An early diagenetic origin for the basal Ediacaran cap carbonates

635 million years ago, the surface of our planet went through dramatic changes during the aftermath of the last great Snowball Earth. This period is marked by conspicuous dolostone units that cap glacial deposits worldwide -- the basal Ediacaran cap dolostones. By measuring calcium and magnesium isotope ratios in cap dolostone units from across the world, we have identified spatial patterns of fluid flow that record the circulation of glacial seawater beneath the seafloor during Snowball Earth deglaciation. This research has revealed that the geochemical variability recorded in cap dolostones largely is the product of local diagenetic processes expressed globally in continental margins.

## The Trezona carbon isotope anomaly

The descent into the last great Snowball Earth glaciation is recorded by an extreme negative carbon isotope excursion -- The Trezona anomaly. This pre-glacial excursion is found globally in carbonate rocks and reaches enigmatic values of -10 per mill. Through measurements of calcium and magnesium isotopes, I am exploring the relative timing and potential drivers for this excursion.
