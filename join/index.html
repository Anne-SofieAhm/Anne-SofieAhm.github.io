<h2> Graduate studies at SEOS </h2>
<p>
  Are you interested in Earth history research? Currently, we are looking for
  motivated students to join the Earth history group! Please reach out to Dr. Ahm
  to discuss opportunities for Masters and PhD projects.
  While there are no fixed deadlines in applying for admission to the School of Earth and Ocean
  Sciences, it is good to reach out to potential faculty advisors early.
  There are three entry points for admission: January, May and September. The Faculty of
  Graduate Studies does indicate that applications should be submitted as early as
  possible and that no assurance can be given that domestic applications received
  after May 31 or international applications received after December 15 can be
  processed in time to permit registration in the following Winter Session (Fall term).
